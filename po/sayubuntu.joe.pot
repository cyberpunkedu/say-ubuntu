"'A person with ubuntu is open and available to others, affirming of others, "

"proper self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she belongs in a "
"greater whole and is diminished when others are humiliated or diminished, "
"when others are tortured or oppressed.' --Archbishop Desmond Tutu <br />"
